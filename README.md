## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to how mix up the usage of flexbox and grid. This project made me realize,
that flexbox is useful if you want your layout to be horizontal or vertical.
I initial it works more like grid but know I understand the exact difference.

## Acknowledgments

I learned from Mosh Hammadani's course on codewithmosh.com. He's a great guy and
he definitly know how to teach to understand. Whenever I stucked on anything I just
go back to his well curated course and rewatch the part that I want.
